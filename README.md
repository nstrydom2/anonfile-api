This unofficial Python API was created to make uploading and downloading files
from https://anonfiles.com simple and effective for programming in Python. The goal of
the project is to create an intuitive library for anonymous file sharing.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local
machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to
deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Python 3.8+ is required to run this application, other than that there are no
prerequisites for the project, as the dependencies are included in the repository.

### Installing

To install the library is as simple as running

```bash
pip install anonfile
```

from the command line. To install this library in debug mode with dev dependencies, use

```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
```

instead. It is recommended to create an virtual environment prior
to installing this library. If you only intend to use this library from the CLI,
use [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) for the installation instead:

```bash
pipx install anonfile
```

### Dev Notes

Run unit tests locally:

```bash
pytest --verbose -s [--token "REDACTED"]
```

Add the `-k test_*` option if you want to test only a single function.

## Usage

Import the module and instantiate the `AnonFile()` constructor. Setting the download
directory in `path` is optional. Using the API `token` in the constructor is optional
as well. A valid `token` registers all file uploads online, i.e. a list of all uploaded
files is made accessible to any user that [signs into your account](https://anonfiles.com/login).

```python
from anonfile import AnonFile

anon = AnonFile()

# upload a file and enable progressbar terminal feedback (off by default)
upload = anon.upload('/home/guest/jims_paperwork.doc', progressbar=True)
print(upload.url.geturl())

# download a file and set the download directory
from pathlib import Path
target_dir = Path.home().joinpath('Downloads')
download = anon.download("https://anonfiles.com/9ee1jcu6u9/test_txt", path=target_dir)
print(download.file_path)
```

And voil√†, pain-free anonymous file sharing. If you want more information about
the `AnonFile` API visit [anonfiles.com](https://anonfiles.com/docs/api).

## Command Line Interface

```bash
# open help page for specific commands
anonfile [download|upload|preview|log] --help

# note: both methods expect at least one argument, but can take on more
anonfile download --url https://anonfiles.com/93k5x1ucu0/test_txt
anonfile upload --file ./test.txt
```
